            <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">Before you dive into the list of the cats that live in my neighborhood, first know that we have never bought or adopted a cat.
            Every single cat we have has either been born here or just appeared in our back yard one day. We also have no permanent indoor
            cats (though we do keep kittens inside until they are old enough to go out) so all of our cats either live outside or come inside
            occasionally. I've organized this list by date of arrival, and in the list below you can click on a cat's picture to be taken
            directly to their section. Enjoy, the Cats & the Kids!

                  <p>Cinnamon is our oldest cat, who originally was found hiding on top of our storage shed in the corner of the yard. Before her,
                     we wouldn't let any cats in the house, however she found herself a way to be let in by proving herself as an excellent mouse
                     hunter, a job which she has now retired from after singlehandedly removing approximately 12 mice. She tolerates
                     our other cats but for the most part likes to be by herself. When she <i>is</i> by herself, she becomes playful and carries
                     her cat toy around the house. Her favorite activity is attacking whatever paper I have on my desk.

                  </ul>
                  <p>Scout is next to Cinnamon in age, though I don't know either of their exact ages. She was also friends with Cinnamon, which is
                  how she found herself at our house by simply following Cinnamon here. Before Scout had her kittens, she was very docile and
                  sheepish however after becoming a mom this all changed. Scout was very active, playful, and fierce, especially with protecting
                  her two young ones. When she first was taking care of them, she actually didn't seem to know how to feed them, which was worrying
                  until we found a way to show her how to do it. Scout's favorite activity was finding new ways to trick people into letting her
                  bite them.

               <h3>Jaws</h3>
               <ul>

               </ul>
               <p>Jaws has lived as everyone's "community cat" in the neighborhood for quite some time, but one day he found himself in our
                  backyard and was excited to meet all the other cats. A bit to excited however as he scared the other cats away from him, and
                  caused a lot of chaos from cats being unhappy with him invading their little backyard area. I named him Jaws because as soon as
                  he met me, he bit my shirt and wouldn't let go of me until I pet his head. This was the little game Jaws liked to play, though he
                  doesn't do that anymore. We also had to save Jaws's life once, when he got an abcess on his paw which the vet clinic told us
                  would have certainly killed him if we didn't bring him in that very day. Despite this, Jaws is very mean and doesn't like being
                  pet whatsoever unless strangers are there to see him, in which he will roll around and purr as if he was completely friendly.
                  Jaw's favorite activity is scamming passerbys to get them to buy him cans in return for letting them pet him.

               </ul>
               <p>Shadow, nicknamed Mini Mama, originally showed up on our back deck on a very cold night, a small little black cat trying to
                  grab dinner in the winter. We brought her inside, and let her investigate. Shadow did live as a mostly indoor cat, especially
                  after she came home one day pregnant with a litter of 5 kittens. She was a smart cat, and would pick them up and move them
                  around whenever she wanted them to walk around the house or come back to their baby home, a little basket. The hidden location
                  of said basket was specifically chosen by Shadow herself. Shadow cared for them for a good while but eventually wanted to flee
                  from her 5 little ones and was happy with being by herself, similarly to Cinnamon, who she also was friends with. Shadow is now
                  an outdoor cat, who will sometimes come home to check in, but for the most part roams freely outside. Shadow's favorite activity
                  is playing human finger wack-a-mole.

               <h3>Sugga Mama</h3>
               <ul>
                  <li>Mostly Indoor</li>
                  <li>Living</li>

                  <li><a href="#SuggaKids">Check out her kittens</a></li>
               </ul>
               <p>Sugga Mama is the only cat who was already pregnant when she first showed up. I figure she must have already knew that we would
                  let her in if she was pregnant, because she was, and still is, incredibly friendly and was pushing to get inside of the house
                  with no fear or even hesitance. Out of all of our cats, Sugga has to be the most calm and peaceful. Even when she wants to be
                  pet or rubbed, she will sit next to you and patiently wait until you are ready to scratch her head or rub her belly. Sometimes,
                  she'll play with random things left on the floor like twist ties or pens in secret, and then when she sees someone watching her,
                  pretend as if she was just sitting around doing nothing. Sugga Mama's favorite activity is sleeping like a queen.
